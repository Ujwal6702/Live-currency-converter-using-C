# **Live currency converter using C**

## Objective

To create a program that uses the live value of the currency exchange rates in the market and gives out the exchange value output based on the input of currency chosen and the value given.

## Problems faced

1. C is an old language, so it did not have a web scraping option.
2. Creating a GUI-based application was hard to accomplish within the given time limit and in our experience.

## Solutions

1. We used python as a supporter code which scrapes the data from the Internet and stores the value in a text file which is later ready by the C program, and the desired output is then further presented.
2. For the GUI part, we just used command line codes to change the color and the way it looks.
